# ccglab-grammars
sample grammars written in CCGlab, for linguistic analyses, modeling, training, etc.

<b>If you have a CCglab grammar developed, feel free to send a pull request.
We will put it up in this repo.</b>

In each folder:

  .ccg file is the source grammar you type. 

  .ded file is the lisp-ready code ccglab generates for linguistic analysis.

  .ind file is the lisp-ready code ccglab uses for training and parse ranking.

  .sup file is for training from sentence-lf pairs.

Other files are auxiliary.

These grammars will be separated from ccglab source code soon for easier update.
